Recent Menu
==========

Recent Menu is a shiny little menu item, sitting around in you menu bar and showing files and folders recently accessed on your computer. Define which types of recently accessed items to show by creating custom filters for file types or filenames. Click on a menu entry to open an item, press the command key and click to show it in Finder.

Updates in Recent Menu 1.2.4:

* Fixed some compiler warnings
* Introduced Retina menu bar icon
* Fixed dark mode menu bar bug on OS X 10.10
